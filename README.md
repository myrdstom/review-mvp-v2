# Setup
- Download and install `node` and `npm` [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Download and install `yarn` from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
- Run `yarn` to install the necessary packages
- run `yarn start` to run the application locally

# Hosting

- Run `yarn build` and `yarn deploy` to deploy the application changes on `gh-pages`
- Application is hosted [here](https://flamboyant-saha-52c581.netlify.app)

# Notes
- Leveraged existing projects to set up linking
- Did not have enough time to get 100% code coverage but wrote some unit tests to show my understanding. 
  Comfortable with e2e tests too.

- Did not use any state management but for a larger application, `react context` or `redux` would  be preferable
